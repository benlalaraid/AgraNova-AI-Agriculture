# 🌾 AgraNova: AI for Sustainable Agriculture in Algeria

AgraNova is an AI-driven agricultural toolkit designed to address key challenges in Algeria's farming sector. This repository contains three core Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how machine learning and computer vision can improve agricultural decision-making and resource management.

## 📂 Notebooks Included

1. **Crop Recommendation**
   - Recommends optimal crops for specific regions based on soil data, weather patterns, and national agricultural priorities.
   - Uses machine learning models with integration of drought and soil analysis.

2. **Plant Disease Detection**
   - Identifies plant leaf diseases using a CNN model trained on the PlantVillage dataset.
   - Offers mobile-app integration for farmers with offline disease diagnosis and treatment suggestions.

3. **Drought and Water Stress Analysis**
   - Predicts drought conditions using climate reanalysis data (ERA5-Land) and Random Forest classification.
   - Supports irrigation planning and disaster preparedness with up to 3 months of early warning.

## 🌍 Use Case

These notebooks are part of the **AgraNova system**, developed for an Algerian AI competition to build innovative, scalable solutions for food security, climate resilience, and agricultural sustainability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
- Satellite data (ERA5-Land, SoilGrids)
- CNNs, Random Forest, Decision Trees
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Results Highlights

- 🔍 Plant disease detection: **83% accuracy** on unseen data
- 🌾 Yield prediction: **R² = 0.961** using Decision Tree Regressor
- 💧 Drought forecast: **90% accuracy** up to 3 months in advance
